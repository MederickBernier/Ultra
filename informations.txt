this folder will contain the folder and file structure for the new projects

requirements

Sapper aka Sveltekit
Nginx
SlimPhp
Redis
Redis-Commander
Mysql
Phpmyadmin
Vite
Composer
Directus
PHP 8.1

So each sub-system will have his own dockerfile and the docker-compose.yml will build all of them based on requirements.

gotta have to look into dynamic requirements for docker, if it's even possible.

Naming Convention and PSR compliance

PSR-1:


    Only <?php or <?= are allowed for PHP tags.
    Class names must be defined in UpperCamelCase.
    Class variables must be defined in camelCase.
    Class constants must be defined in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.
    Method names must be defined in camelCase.
    Files SHOULD either declare symbols (classes, functions, constants, etc.)  or cause side effects(e.g. generate output, change .ini settings, etc.) but SHOULD NOT do both. I.e.,    
    Files must be in UTF-8 without BOM(Byte Order Mark).
    Namespaces and class names must follow the standards in PSR-0 and PSR-4.


PSR-2:


    You must follow the PSR-1 coding standards.
    4 spaces must be used for indents. Using tabs is not allowed.
    There is no limit to line length, but it should be under 120 characters, and best if under 80.
    There must be one blank line after namespace declaration and there must be one blank line after the block of use declaration.
    Opening curly braces for classes and methods must go on the next line and closing curly braces must go on the line after the body.
    Methods and properties must be defined with abstract/final first, followed with public/protected, and finally static keyword.
    You must not put a newline before curly braces in conditional statements.
    You must not put any spaces before ( and ) in conditional statements.
    An example for defining classes:
    You must open the curly braces on the new line and the extends and the implements keyword must be used in a single line.

    Conditional Statements:
    
    You must put one whitespace before (
    You must not put any whitespaces after (
    You must not put any whitespaces before )
    You must put one whitespace after )
    use elseif rather than else if.

    Switch statements: 
    
    The curly braces must be opened in the same line where the switch statement is written.
    The case body must be indented once from the case and the case must be indented once from the switch.
    Use no break when break is not needed.
    You can also use return instead of break.
